						I started reading with one clear goal: to read like a student and complete the writing prompt. A few minutes in, I got distracted... which is pretty normal for me. The prompt soon floated to the back of my mind. Particularly, when Bunn implied quoting Obama at the beginning of an essay is divisive. This jumped out at me because politics in the US has become increasingly more polarized since 2016 when Bunn published this piece. I began comparing the choice of choosing an Obama quote to start an essay to choosing a Trump or Biden quote. To me choosing an Obama quote is much less of a divisive choice because in my opinion, the political tensions in 2016 were tamer in comparison to now. It is interesting how incredibly different the connotations of choosing a quote from each of these three presidents is. They are all presidents that were elected in the U.S. in consecutive order. How can so much change so quickly? After I thought about how strange this was, I collected my thoughts and got back to reading like a student.
		
							My thoughts bounced around from the writing prompt to other random observations. I observed things from Bunn’s writing that applied to everything from my childhood, to my breakfast, and finally to my major: Biology & Computer Science. By the end, I realized even when starting with a focused goal of “reading like a student” I cannot help “reading like Mia.” I reflected on this and was first upset that I cannot shut off my brain and stick to one task, but then I thought maybe it’s a good thing. If I just focused solely on reading like a student, I would never have gone on that interesting tangent comparing presidents or made those connections to my childhood. The experience of reading Bunn’s excerpt affected me in more ways than just to complete my writing prompt.
							
							Even though the childhood example may be trivial, bringing my whole self to whatever I do helps me make new interdisciplinary or personal connections. After all, my major, computer science and biology, would have never existed if people from different backgrounds didn't bring their perspectives outside of their immediate disciplines. I have accepted my scatter-brained nature and am on a mission to use it for good. I want to continue to consume media while making all sorts of connections, but also be able to communicate my ideas in a clear way that is not scatter-brained. I am still working on this, but I hope to get better. :)
