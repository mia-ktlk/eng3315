					<p style="line-height: 2;" >I swore I'd never be a programmer. My mom was a programmer; my dad was a programmer. My parents said it was “hardcoded” in my genes. They think of programming as an educational necessity, as imperative as learning to tie your shoe. When I was young, I railed against their attempts to bolster my “genetic potential” and sought to avoid anything programming related at all costs.

                        In elementary school, my cousin Kayli and I devoted many obsessed hours on a site called Neopets. We had a childish rivalry competing for coveted Neopoints. Kayli convinced me to foolishly pay half my Neopoints to another user for a Neoweb page design leaving me far behind in the race to the most Neopoints. Frustrated, I decided to create my own Neoweb page designs and sell them to other users. When investigating how to design sites, I discovered the languages of the web: HTML/CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Instantly fascinated, I created and sold many designs for Neopoints. Kayli could not keep up and my Neopoint revenue skyrocketed. My mom inadvertently discovered my adventures in web development, and teased me - smugly remarking, "I knew you would love programming." As a 7-year-old who never programmed before I was astonished the web design work I was doing could be included under the definition of programming. I had fallen victim to parental manipulation. Humiliated, I vowed to quit and never program again.
                        
                        Despite my resistance, programming haunted all that I did. Next year at Christmas I unwrapped a present that was seemingly my dad’s old dell laptop. When I excitedly ripped the box open I found a Python programming book instead. My parents offered a challenge. Learn the first half of the book, and win your very own computer. I promised myself upon receipt of the computer, all programming would stop. However, 20 pages was all it took for my programming curiosity to transform into an obsession.
                        
                        All through middle school and high school, I kept my interest in programming learning new languages and solving new problems, but I did not talk about it. Part of the reason I was stubborn about accepting my coding interests is because I always wanted to be a doctor. I was always fascinated with how the human body works and I dreamed of performing medical research. Whenever I would share that dream with my mom she would shoot it down and tell me to be a programmer instead. In her eyes, programming was a very family-friendly job – specifically a stay-at-home mother job. I once overheard her at a party tell her friend “it is my worst fear that Mia goes to medical school, wastes her childbearing years, and never starts a family.” It hurt so much hearing my greatest dream was my mom’s worst nightmare. That sadness translated into stubbornness to accept programming as something I liked to do. I saw it as an obstacle to my dreams.
                        
                        One day I was sitting outside working on a programming project. A passerby noticed the language was Python and offered me a job in her lab. I spent the rest of the summer working in her lab and discovered what I was truly meant to do. I had never thought to apply my CS skills to medical research and when I finally did my soul lit up. This is why I chose the combined major of biology and computer science. I am still stubborn about admitting my interest in programming to my parents – I guess I am still not over my mom’s comment at that party.</div>
