					<p style="line-height: 2;" >It is prayer week. We memorize words and repeat them 100 times until we can go eat lunch. The more they are said the less I know what they mean. I never learned the definitions of these words anyways “art thou” “fruit of thy womb” what does it mean to be “delivered from evil.” I guess it doesn’t matter just say them and I can get food. Nicholas fell asleep, now he has to stand and recite 100 times more. He doesn’t get lunch today. By tomorrow I need to say all of the prayers from memory or I won’t get to go to lunch either. I need to practice more.

                        Anna comes over to my house. She goes to a different school. “Who is this?” she asks pointing to a picture of Mary. “That is Mary? You don’t recognize her?” She shakes her head. She doesn’t recognize Mary? She needs to practice more.
                        
                        Our entire class is outside. Our teachers switch off choosing names and telling us to line up in order. It seems all of the teacher’s pets are at the front of the line. That’s not me. I’m not a troublemaker, but I’m not a good enough liar to be the teacher’s favorite. I need to practice more.
                        
                        “Abraham would kill his son with an ax because he loves God so much. Tell me you love Jesus more than your parents.” Head down, I reply “of course I do.” She looks unsatisfied with my answer. “Look me in the eyes and say it again.” Deep breath. “I love Jesus more than my parents.” She walks past. I’m safe. Brett won’t say it. He’s crying “I would never kill my mom” he is taken to the principal’s office. His cover was blown. He should be more careful. Lying is a sin, but how is taking an ax to your parents, not a sin? Anyways, Brett needs to practice more.
                        
                        “Why do you think you are lined up in this order?” the teachers ask. They make us guess. “are we lined up in order of best grades?”, “No… that’s not quite it” “are we in order of best behavior?” “No... but close.” None of our guesses are correct. The longer I stand there looking at all the kids who ranked before me the worse I feel about myself. Then they tell us. “You are ordered according to who is the best person as a whole. This is a combination of your intelligence, your kindness, your faith, and your worth. To the children in the front, good job! Children in the back, you need to practice more.”</div>
