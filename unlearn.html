					<p style="line-height: 2;" >When I turned 12 my aunt gave me a checklist that she hung on the mirror in my bedroom.

                        Does this outfit fit me or cling to me?
                        Does this wardrobe complement my personality or distract from it?
                        By the way I dress am I inviting guys to act like gentlemen?
                        What is my outfit asking for?
                        If I wanted to be used by a guy, how would I dress?
                        At 12 I was way more interested in catching the toads in my backyard than I was in boys. I had never thought about my clothes in relation to anyone else but myself. My wardrobe was full of my favorite color, pink, comfortable tank tops and shorts that worked well for the 100-degree Arizona heat. After reading this list I felt so much shame. How could I be so selfish to not think of the men around me when I dress. As I went through puberty and my body continued to change, I felt even more shame every time I looked in the mirror. I grew up wearing oversized t-shirts and baggy cargo pants in effort to hide my body and not be "disrespectful” to men.
                        
                        One of my mom’s friends had a retirement party and she was hosting it at a very fancy hotel. My mom was really excited and took me shopping to find a dress – something I rarely wore. She picked one out for me that was absolutely beautiful. It was red with a plunging neckline (in retrospect the neckline was not actually low at all I just remember it being so), and a cut that lined my body (again the dress was not actually that tight I just thought it was). I tried it on in the dressing room and I thought it looked amazing, but I was too scared to leave the room. My mom saw the dress and told me I looked beautiful and bought it for the party.
                        
                        In the weeks before the event I would occasionally wear the dress in the privacy of my room to get used to seeing my body like that. I liked the way it looked but I could not help but feel terrible inside. The night of the party I ended up wearing a large jacket for most of the night and halfway through the party I got so uncomfortable that I ran to the bathroom and vomited from the nerves. My mom realized my discomfort and told me I should not be ashamed of my body. She said, “dressing feminine inspires masculinity in men and proves that a woman is worth being courteous to.” This idea, while also very problematic, at the time, made me feel better about my body. I started wearing more traditionally “feminine” clothing that was less baggy and had floral or “girly” fabric hoping to show men I am “worth respecting.”
                        
                        Around this time, I became friends with another girl in my class. She was beautiful, smart and very outspoken. She never kept her opinions to herself and if she had a problem with something, she would tell you.  Whenever I would go to her house, we would play a game called “fashion designer” where she would pick out things for me to wear and take pictures of them for the “Spring catalog.”  Sometimes I would question her “designs” with what was on my checklist saying things like “what is this outfit asking for?” “is this what I would wear if I wanted to be used?” She was absolutely appalled by this mindset. She told me to wear clothes for me and not for anyone else. She would say “Look at your smile in that outfit. You are wearing that for you” or “You were born the way you were born. Your body and your appearance is not your responsibility to hide.” It took years of spending time with her to be able to embrace my body and not feel nauseated when I looked in the mirror.
                        
                        Although now I have let go of any notion to “dress for men” I still have residual shame that seeps into my thoughts sometimes. I know the reason for this feeling is not logical. But many of these ideas that were mashed into my brain year after year for the majority of my life are very hard to unlearn. In theory I have “unlearned” these ideas but in practice those checklist items have been etched into my eyeballs so deep that I had no problem recalling them in full for this reflection.</div>
