					<p style="line-height: 2;" >I have never had to look long and hard to find representation for myself in STEM. All through middle school and high school, I worked in freelance web and software development. I was often the youngest and the only woman in the room. But I never felt unrepresented or even thought about it much. I am so lucky that I had this privilege and I owe it all to my mom.
                        
                        My mom is a first-generation Mexican immigrant who grew in Compton, California. She loved to read and became obsessed with books about computer hardware and programming. After high school, she went to UCSD and got involved with a small group of students who were interested in computers just like her. They ended up starting the computer science department at UCSD. After graduating she worked as a software developer and engineer at many companies all around the world. My dad was also working in computer science, but he didn’t go to school for it. My mom was seen as the “expert.” Whenever I had a question my dad couldn’t solve, it was always “ask your mom she knows.” She has been such a strong and shining example of a Latina in tech and I could see myself in her. She always built up my confidence and never gave me the space to question my place or value in tech.
                        
                        It wasn’t until I moved away from home and started college that I realized how big of a problem representation in STEM is. Many of my peers would share stories of imposter syndrome and sexism and I realized how privileged I was to grow up with my mom. Her example and support created a protective shell around me that kept me from giving in to sexist comments or actions I experienced in my classes or on the job.
                        
                        People underestimate the importance of small acts of representation, like books and TV shows that show confidence, well-developed minority characters succeeding and enjoying STEM. But I know from experience that just being able to see yourself in a role model can make such a difference. I am so grateful that I could always find myself in my mom.
                        
                         
                        
                        Post-script:
                        
                        My mom’s story is so much more than the little excerpt I shared, and she didn’t do it all on her own. Her mom (my grandma) sacrificed her whole life working long hours picking fruit and being exploited by racist and unacceptable working conditions. Some may see my mom’s story as an idealized “American Dream,” but my family spent generations fighting against a system built against them. Luckily, they were able to survive, but many didn’t. Politicians like to say America encourages and supports those in pursuit of the “American Dream” and that hard work is all it takes. In reality, it takes enduring circumstances that are inhumane and risking incarceration and death to hopefully eventually slither through a system that is stacked against you. Stories of the “American Dream” may be inspirational but they should inspire change in the system and not perpetuate the false narrative that this can be attained by any immigrant if only they work hard. Idolizing the "American Dream" allows people to normalize the oppression immigrants have to endure as a part of their path to their dream. </p><div class="mt-3 row text-right">
