						I am an only child. I grew up in Tucson, Arizona in an area that was mostly desert. All of my neighbors were 65 or older. Besides school, I didn’t really get to play with kids my own age. I kept myself busy with a series of unique games.

 

“Foot to the Wall” – There is a scene in The Incredibles where Mr. Incredible, Bob, throws his boss through several walls of a building. Bob’s boss ends up in the hospital with a few broken bones including his legs. He has his legs in a cast suspended upwards. 
For some reason, I really wanted to suspend my legs too. It turns out you can do this with a large box of bulletin board tacks, and some string. Tie one end to the tack and tie the other around your foot. Then repeat for all 100 or so tacks in the box. Push all the tacks into the ceiling and your foot will be suspended. The foot weight is distributed across all the tacks allowing them to hold your foot up just like the boss in The Incredibles. This process takes a while, but it can be very rewarding. I was always really proud of getting my foot suspended and would call my mom over to show off my work. She was always very confused but supportive of my "ingenuity." We ended up moving out of this house years later and my mom had to explain to the realtor why there were thousands of tiny thumbtack holes in the ceiling.

 

“Midnight Fright” – At midnight I would crawl out my bedroom window and stand in my driveway until I got too scared and would run back inside. I did not like this game very much. I always dreaded doing it because I was really scared of the dark, but for some reason, I thought it was necessary to conquer this fear to “become an adult.” I don’t think it worked. I am still scared of walking places alone at night – but that is probably a healthy fear.
 

“Brazilian car seat torture” – I had a car seat made by the Brazilian company “Peg Perego.” It had two plastic holes on either side just big enough for my six-year-old fingers. In the summer, the metal screws in the car seat holes would heat up and hurt when touched. In my mind, I was a super-spy gathering intelligence in a Brazilian town called Peg Perego. Unfortunately, I was caught by enemies and they were holding me in this car seat as torture and forcing me to put my fingers on the hot metal screws. The object of the game was to keep touching the screws for the duration of the car ride. Obviously, my favorite TV show at the time was “Get Smart” and my favorite movie was “Casino Royale”.
 

If you ever want to gain insight into what it is like growing up in the desert as an only child, feel free to play some of these games. They are more fun than they might seem.</p>
